  - Saving
    - USE:
      - spacebar to save everything & screenshot (PERSISTED)
      - clone pattern into new one (PERSISTED)
      - save pattern node as (PERSISTED)
      - other users commiting modifications?
      - periodic pattern snapshots
    - STEPS:
      - PERSIST DATA
        - what is persisted?
        - how is it persisted?
        - where is it persisted?
      - ui
      - periodic save system
      - partial saving, loading?

    - TWO POSSIBLE OPERATIONS
      - append new user data
      - modify something(core or existing data)

    - ONLY APPENDS FOR NOW?
      -

    - serialize entire state
      - make sure to set flags correctly (on a clone, or what?)
    - post state to server
      - local or remote?
    - recieved state:
      - backup current state
      - unpack recieved state
        - unpack into correct directories
        - bundle
      - swap



- FIRST STEP:
  - serialize live tree & store it on disk as user/*
  - this is a whole pattern
    - everything live & systemConfD.pattern
    - need to change flags & ids.  data is named
      - so we need to clone the data
        - basically re-import pattern, but with some flags
